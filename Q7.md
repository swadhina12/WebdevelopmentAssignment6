### Q.7  Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?
Ans:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It establishes a parent-child relationship between classes, where the child class (subclass) inherits characteristics from the parent class (superclass).

The purpose of inheritance is to promote code reuse, enhance modularity, and establish a hierarchical relationship between classes. It allows for the creation of new classes that are based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and behaviors, and extending or modifying them as needed.

The main benefits of inheritance include:

1-Code reuse: Inheritance allows subclasses to inherit attributes and methods from a superclass, reducing the need to duplicate code. This promotes code reuse and helps in maintaining and evolving the software more efficiently.

2-Modularity and hierarchy: Inheritance facilitates the creation of a hierarchical class structure. Common attributes and behaviors can be defined in a superclass, and specialized subclasses can inherit and extend them. This modular approach helps in organizing and managing complex systems.

3-Polymorphism: Inheritance is closely related to polymorphism, as it enables objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common superclass. Polymorphism allows for writing generic code that can work with objects of different types, but still achieve a common behavior or functionality.

4-Flexibility and extensibility: Inheritance provides a mechanism to introduce new classes without modifying existing code. New subclasses can inherit and reuse the code and behavior of the superclass, while adding or modifying specific features. This makes the system more flexible, adaptable, and easier to extend.

5-Overriding and specialization: Subclasses have the ability to override methods inherited from the superclass, providing their own implementation. This allows for specialization, where subclasses can tailor the behavior of inherited methods to their specific needs.

Overall, inheritance is a key concept in OOP that enables code reuse, modularity, and the establishment of hierarchical relationships between classes. It helps in building flexible, extensible, and maintainable software systems.
