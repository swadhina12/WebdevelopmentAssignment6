### Q.8 Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?
Ans:Encapsulation is an object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that refers to the bundling of data and methods into a single unit called a class. It is one of the fundamental principles of OOP along with inheritance and polymorphism.

The purpose of encapsulation is to hide the internal details of an object and provide a public interface through which other objects can interact with it. It promotes the idea of data hiding and information hiding, ensuring that the internal state and implementation details of an object are not directly accessible to other objects. Instead, access to the object's data and behavior is controlled through well-defined methods or functions.

By encapsulating data within an object, we can achieve several benefits:

1-Data protection: Encapsulation helps protect the data within an object from being accessed or modified by unauthorized code. It allows us to define access levels, such as public, private, or protected, which determine the visibility and accessibility of data to other objects.

2-Modularity and code organization: Encapsulation allows us to group related data and methods together within a class. This improves code organization and helps create modular and maintainable code by keeping related functionality together.

3-Abstraction: Encapsulation enables abstraction by exposing only essential information and hiding the implementation details. This simplifies the usage of objects, as other objects can interact with them using a well-defined interface without needing to know the internal workings.

4-Code reusability: Encapsulation facilitates code reuse by providing a clear separation between the internal implementation of an object and its external interface. This allows objects to be used in different contexts without affecting their functionality, as long as the interface remains consistent.

Overall, encapsulation helps in building more robust and flexible software systems by providing a clear separation between different components, protecting data integrity, and promoting modular and maintainable code.
