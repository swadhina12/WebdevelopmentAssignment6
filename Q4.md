### Q.4 Explain OOPS ? 
Ans:OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming System. It is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes representing real-world entities or concepts. OOPS focuses on encapsulating data and behavior within objects, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code. Here's an explanation of some key concepts in OOPS:

1-Objects:

* Objects are the fundamental building blocks in OOPS.
An object represents a specific instance of a class and encapsulates both data (attributes or properties) and behavior (methods or functions).
* Objects can interact with each other by invoking methods and accessing properties.

2-Classes:

* A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.
* It defines the attributes and methods that objects of that class will possess.
Objects are created based on the class definition, and each object is an instance of a class.

3-Encapsulation:

* Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data and methods together within an object.
It allows data to be hidden from the outside world and accessed only through defined methods.
* Encapsulation provides data security, prevents unauthorized access, and enables better control over the internal state of an object.

4-Inheritance:

* Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass or base class).
* It enables code reuse, abstraction, and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.
Subclasses can extend or override the behavior of the superclass while inheriting its common attributes and methods.

5-Polymorphism:

* Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on different forms or behaviors based on the context.
It allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, providing flexibility and modularity in code design.
* Polymorphism enables method overriding, method overloading, and the use of interfaces or abstract classes.

6-Abstraction:

* Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential features and hiding unnecessary details.
* It focuses on defining interfaces, classes, and methods that provide necessary functionality without exposing internal implementation details.
* Abstraction helps in creating modular and maintainable code by promoting code reusability and reducing complexity.

7-Encapsulation:

* Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data and methods together within an object.
* It allows data to be hidden from the outside world and accessed only through defined methods.
* Encapsulation provides data security, prevents unauthorized access, and enables better control over the internal state of an object.

OOPS provides a structured and organized approach to software development, allowing for better code organization, code reusability, and scalability. It promotes modular design, separation of concerns, and abstraction, which aid in building complex systems and maintaining large codebases effectively.
