### Q.3 Whatâ€™s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them?
Ans:In JavaScript, call, apply, and bind are three methods available on functions that allow you to manipulate the this value and invoke functions in different ways. Here's an explanation of each method and the differences between them:

1-call method:

* The call method allows you to invoke a function with a specified this value and individual arguments passed in directly.
* It takes the this value as its first argument, followed by comma-separated arguments.
* The function is invoked immediately with the provided this value and arguments.

Example:
```JavaScript
function greet(message) {
  console.log(message + ', ' + this.name);
}

const person = { name: 'John' };

greet.call(person, 'Hello'); // Output: Hello, John
```
2-apply method:

* The apply method is similar to call, but it accepts arguments as an array or an array-like object.
* It takes the this value as its first argument, followed by an array-like object or an actual array containing the arguments.
* The function is invoked immediately with the provided this value and the arguments from the array.

Example:
```JavaScript
function greet(message) {
  console.log(message + ', ' + this.name);
}

const person = { name: 'John' };
const args = ['Hello'];

greet.apply(person, args); // Output: Hello, John
```
3-bind method:

* The bind method returns a new function with a bound this value and optionally pre-set arguments.
* It does not immediately invoke the function but creates a new function with the specified this value and arguments.
* The returned function can be invoked later when needed.

Example:
```JavaScript
function greet(message) {
  console.log(message + ', ' + this.name);
}

const person = { name: 'John' };
const greetPerson = greet.bind(person, 'Hello');

greetPerson(); // Output: Hello, John
```
>Differences between call, apply, and bind:

* Arguments: call and apply accept arguments directly or as an array-like object, whereas bind accepts arguments individually or partially pre-sets arguments.
* Invocation: call and apply immediately invoke the function, whereas bind returns a new function that can be invoked later.
* this Value: call and apply set the this value directly, while bind creates a new function with the bound this value.
* Return Value: call and apply return the result of the invoked function, whereas bind returns a new function.

These methods provide flexibility in how you invoke functions and control the this value within different contexts. They are useful for function reuse, borrowing methods from one object to another, and achieving function currying or partial application.
