### Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?
Ans:In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects that share the same properties and behaviors. It is a way to define a custom data type, encapsulating related data and functions into a single entity.

JavaScript introduced class syntax in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a more familiar and structured approach to object-oriented programming. Prior to ES6, JavaScript used prototypes for object creation and inheritance.

To define a class in JavaScript, you use the class keyword followed by the class name. Here's an example of a simple class declaration:

```JavaScript
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}
```
In the above example, we define a Rectangle class with a constructor and a getArea method. The constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It initializes the object's properties (width and height in this case). The getArea method calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.

To create an instance (object) of a class, you use the new keyword followed by the class name and any necessary arguments:

```JavaScript
const myRectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10);
```
In the example above, we create a new instance of the Rectangle class, passing 5 and 10 as arguments to the constructor. The myRectangle object now has its own width and height properties and can invoke the getArea method.

One important thing to note is that JavaScript classes are syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model. Under the hood, classes still use prototypes for object creation and inheritance. The class syntax provides a more structured and intuitive way to work with objects and their prototypes.

JavaScript classes can also have static methods, which are methods that are attached to the class itself rather than its instances. Static methods can be called directly on the class, without needing to create an object.

```JavaScript
class MathUtils {
  static add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}
```
console.log(MathUtils.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
In the above example, the MathUtils class has a static method add, which adds two numbers. We can call the add method directly on the class without creating an instance of it.

Overall, classes in JavaScript provide a convenient and structured way to create objects with shared properties and behaviors. They help in organizing code, promoting code reuse, and implementing object-oriented principles.
