### Q.2 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?
Ans:In JavaScript, the this keyword is a special identifier that refers to the context in which a function is executed. It provides access to the current object or the object on which a method is being called. The purpose of the this keyword is to enable dynamic and flexible code that can operate on different objects based on the context of execution. Here are some key points about the this keyword and its purpose:

1-Dynamic Context:

* The this keyword allows functions and methods to access and operate on different objects dynamically, depending on how they are called.
* It enables code reusability by allowing the same function or method to work with different objects without needing to know the specific object beforehand.

2-Execution Context:

* The value of this is determined at runtime based on the execution context of a function or method.
* It depends on how a function is invoked and is not determined by how or where the function is defined.
* Different invocation patterns, such as function invocation, method invocation, constructor invocation, or using call() and apply(), can result in different values for this.

3-Object Method Invocation:

* When a function is invoked as a method of an object, this refers to the object itself.
* It allows the method to access and operate on the object's properties and other methods.

Example:

```JavaScript
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + this.name + '!');
  }
};

obj.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, John!
```
4-Function Invocation:

* When a function is invoked standalone (not as a method of an object), this refers to the global object (window in browsers or global in Node.js) in non-strict mode.
* In strict mode, this is undefined in such cases.

Example:
```JavaScript
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello, ' + this.name + '!');
}

sayHello(); // Output: Hello, undefined! (in non-strict mode)
```
5-Constructor Invocation:

* When a function is used as a constructor function with the new keyword, this refers to the newly created object being instantiated.
* It allows the constructor to initialize and set up the properties of the new object.

Example:

```JavaScript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.sayHello = function() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + this.name + '!');
  };
}
const person = new Person('John');
person.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, John!
```

The this keyword provides a powerful mechanism for accessing and operating on objects dynamically, depending on the execution context. Understanding the context and value of this is crucial in JavaScript to ensure proper usage and avoid potential bugs or unexpected behavior.
