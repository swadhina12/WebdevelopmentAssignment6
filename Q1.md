### Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?
Ans:In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method or function that is used to initialize and create objects of a class. It is called automatically when an object is created from a class, and its purpose is to set up the initial state and behavior of the object.

Here are some key points about constructors and their purpose:

1-Object Initialization:

* The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the newly created object with default or provided values.
* It sets up the initial state of the object, assigns values to its properties, and performs any necessary setup tasks.

2-Method Syntax:

* Constructors are defined with the same name as the class they belong to.
* In many programming languages, including JavaScript, constructors are identified by the constructor keyword.

3-Automatic Invocation:

* Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is created from a class using the new keyword.
* When the new keyword is used, it triggers the execution of the constructor to initialize the object.

4-Property Initialization:

* Constructors are often used to assign initial values to the properties of an object.
* They provide a convenient way to set up the object's state by accepting arguments and assigning them to the corresponding properties.

5-Object Setup and Configuration:

* Constructors can perform additional setup and configuration tasks beyond property initialization.
* They can set up relationships between objects, establish connections with databases or external services, and perform any necessary pre-processing.

6-Inheritance:

* Constructors play a crucial role in inheritance, where a subclass can call the constructor of its superclass to initialize inherited properties and behaviors.
* By invoking the superclass constructor within the subclass constructor, the subclass can reuse and extend the functionality of the superclass.

In summary, a constructor is a special method that initializes objects when they are created. Its purpose is to set up the initial state, assign property values, and perform any necessary setup tasks for the object. Constructors help ensure that objects are properly initialized and ready for use, providing a blueprint for creating and configuring objects based on a class definition.
