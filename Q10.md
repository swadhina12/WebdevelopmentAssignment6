### Q.10 Whatâ€™s Super Keyword & What it does?
Ans:In JavaScript, the super keyword is used within a subclass to refer to the parent class or superclass. It is primarily used to call and access the parent class's methods and constructors.

The super keyword can be used in the following ways in JavaScript:

1-To call the superclass constructor: When a subclass is created in JavaScript, the super keyword is used to call the constructor of its superclass. This is necessary to initialize the inherited properties and set up the superclass's state. The super() call must be made before accessing this within the constructor of the subclass.

2-To access superclass methods: The super keyword can be used to access and call methods defined in the parent class. By using super.methodName(), you can invoke the parent class's implementation of a method from within the subclass. This allows the subclass to extend or modify the behavior of the superclass's method.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of super in JavaScript:

```JavaScript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    super.speak();
    console.log(`${this.name} barks!`);
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog('Max', 'Labrador');
myDog.speak();
```
In the above example, the Dog class extends the Animal class. The super(name) call in the Dog class constructor invokes the Animal class constructor, passing the name argument. The speak() method in the Dog class uses super.speak() to call the speak() method of the Animal class before adding its own behavior.

In summary, in JavaScript, the super keyword is used within a subclass to refer to the parent class. It enables calling the parent class constructor and accessing the parent class's methods, allowing for inheritance and method overriding.
