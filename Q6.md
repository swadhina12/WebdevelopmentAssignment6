### Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?
Ans:Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms.

The purpose of polymorphism is to provide a way to write code that can work with objects of different types, but still achieve a common behavior or functionality. It allows you to write generic code that can operate on objects of various classes without the need for explicit type checking or casting.

Polymorphism is typically achieved through inheritance and method overriding. When a superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses, each subclass can provide its own implementation of methods defined in the superclass. At runtime, the appropriate method implementation is selected based on the actual type of the object that the method is called on. This allows for code reuse, flexibility, and extensibility in object-oriented systems.

The main benefits of polymorphism include:

1-Code reuse: Polymorphism promotes reuse of code by allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly, avoiding the need for redundant code.

2-Flexibility: It allows for the introduction of new classes without modifying existing code that relies on the common superclass. This makes the system more flexible and adaptable to changes.

3-Extensibility: Polymorphism allows you to add new functionality to an application by introducing new subclasses that inherit from the same superclass. Existing code can then work with these new objects without modification.

4-Simplicity: Polymorphism simplifies code by providing a common interface or behavior that can be used by different objects. This abstraction helps in managing complexity and improving code readability.

Overall, polymorphism is a fundamental concept in OOP that enables code to be written in a more modular, flexible, and maintainable manner.
